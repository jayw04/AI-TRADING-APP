## ✅ P0 — Scaffolding (complete)

Tag `p0-complete` → `6e66ad9`. (Original 10-group breakdown lives in the v0.1 of this file in git history.)

---

## ✅ P1 — Manual Trading MVP (complete)

Tag `p1-session4-complete` → `48ea67d`. Sessions 1–4 all merged. Trader can place/modify/cancel paper orders against Alpaca from the UI; OrderRouter is the single dispatch path (ADR 0002); risk engine + trade-update consumer + position recompute all live; full REST surface; WS topic publishing; live-mode gates.

| Session | Scope | PR |
|---|---|---|
| **S1** | Alpaca read-only adapter + creds | #1 |
| **S2** | Account/position polling + scheduler + lifespan | #2 |
| **S3** | Trade-updates WS lifecycle | #3 |
| **S4** | Trading DB schema | #4, #5 |
| **S5** | RiskEngine + OrderRouter + trade-update consumer + drift detector | #6 |
| **S5/6** | Full REST + WS topic publishing | #7 |
| **S6 frontend** | Order ticket, orders + positions pages, typed API client | #8 |
| **S6 frontend** | Charts page, real dashboard, live-mode UX gates | #9 |
| **S6 tests** | Coverage gates, REST + e2e tests, runbooks, exit gate | #10 |

## 🚧 P2 — Strategy MVP (in progress)

Goal per Design Doc §13: *"One reference systematic strategy runs end-to-end on paper, with backtest harness + deploy."*

Master plan: [`docs/implementation/TradingWorkbench_P2_Checklist_v0.1.md`](../docs/implementation/TradingWorkbench_P2_Checklist_v0.1.md). Session docs alongside it.

| Session | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **S1** | Bar cache + IndicatorComputer | ✅ #11 |
| **S2** | Strategies framework skeleton (schema, base/context/engine/loader, fixtures) | ✅ #12 |
| **S3** | Reference RSI strategy + backtest harness | ✅ #13 tag `p2-session3-complete` |
| **S4** | Strategies + signals REST surface + WS topic routing | ✅ #16 tag `p2-session4-complete` |
| **S5** | Frontend Strategies pages (CRUD, signals view, backtest modal) | ✅ #18 tag `p2-session5-complete` |
| **S6** | Tests + smoke matrix + runbooks + P2 exit gate | 🚧 PR open: coverage gates + backfill tests + runbooks + README done; smoke matrix + branch-protection promotion + `p2-complete` tag are manual steps after merge |

### P2 known blockers
- AAPL fixture parquets for `tests/strategies/test_backtest_reproducibility.py` and the live smoke step — Norton SSL inspection on Jay's dev machine blocks `data.alpaca.markets`. Generating from any other env (WSL, CI, a non-Norton machine) populates the three parquets and flips two skipped tests to required.
- Live smoke step in P2 S3 / P2 S4 docs is still pending behind that same SSL blocker.

## ⏳ P4 — Polish & extend (partially started, out of stated order)

We ran ahead of the doc order on P4 items because they unblock UI work later. Items are independently mergeable.

| Item | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **§1** | TradingView Pine webhook receiver | ✅ #14 tag `p4-tv-webhooks-complete` |
| **§2 Part A** | Async backtest job queue (backend) | ✅ #17 tag `p4-async-backtest-backend-complete` |
| **§2 Part B** | Async backtest progress UI (frontend) | ✅ #20 tag `p4-async-backtest-complete` |
| **§5** | Backend `source_type` / `source_id` filter on orders + frontend scoped queries | ✅ #22 tag `p4-order-source-filter-complete` |
| **§7** | Typed Params tab form derived from `Strategy.params_schema` | ✅ #23 tag `p4-param-form-complete` |
| **§6** | Backtest charting: drawdown sub-chart + trade markers + Equity/Returns toggle + stats panel | ✅ #24 tag `p4-backtest-charting-complete` |
| **§4** | Strategy hot-reload: file watcher + reload endpoint + UI banner | ✅ #25 tag `p4-strategy-hot-reload-complete` |
| **§3** | Opportunities page: six cross-cutting widgets + aggregator endpoint | ✅ #26 tag `p4-opportunities-page-complete` |
| **§8** | WS bar dispatch: BarStreamService + diff-based subscriptions + cron fallback | ✅ #27 tag `p4-ws-bar-dispatch-complete` |

### P4 §2 ship sequence — DONE 2026-05-26
1. P2 S5 landed the Strategies UI scaffolding (PR #18).
2. P4 §2 Part B layered the WS-driven progress bar + cancel button on top (PR #20).
3. Tag `p4-async-backtest-complete` pushed; both halves shipped.

> Side fix in PR #20: the P2 S5 frontend `BacktestJobStatus` type alias claimed `"done"` but the backend enum serializes `"completed"`. The old modal's success-path check never matched a real backtest — users saw "Running…" forever until dismissing. Type + check both corrected.

---

## 🧱 Cross-cutting work that landed alongside

- **`app/audit/` module** (#15 — `feat(audit): typed AuditLogger`) — introduced `AuditLogger` + `AuditAction` + `AuditActorType` enums. P2 S4 needed them and they weren't built earlier despite the P1.C checkbox above implying they were. Refactored `OrderRouter`, `StrategyEngine`, `TradeUpdateConsumer` to use the typed helper. Cleanup, not new feature.
- **Alembic template fix** (in #14 and re-tweaked in #17) — `script.py.mako` now produces ruff-clean imports on autogenerate; future `alembic revision --autogenerate` calls don't need a manual fixup pass.

## 🚧 P3 — Agent MVP (in progress, started ahead of P2 close)

Goal per Design Doc §10: a Claude-powered chat panel the trader can talk to about positions, recent trades, and current market state. **B1+B2 only** — read-only context + interactive Q&A. No autonomous trading (that's B3, deferred to P6).

Session docs live under uppercase `Docs/implementation/` (still untracked; six P3 + nine P5 + the P4 checklist are pending an inventory commit).

| Session | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **S1** | Agent schema (3 tables, 3 enums) + Alembic + pricing helper + DailyBudgetResolver + settings | ✅ #28 tag `p3-session1-complete` |
| **S2** | MCP server read-only tool expansion: 12 new tools + tripwire + runbook (`docs/runbook/mcp-tools.md`) | ✅ #29 tag `p3-session2-complete` |
| **S3** | Agent runtime: Anthropic client + system prompt + session lifecycle + tool-use loop + bilateral cost cap. Constrained by [ADR 0006](../docs/adr/0006-llm-not-in-order-path.md); B3_AUTONOMOUS paused indefinitely. | ✅ #31 tag `p3-session3-complete` |
| **S4** | REST + WS surface: 6 endpoints under `/api/v1/agent` + `agent` WS topic (5 bus events + 128-event replay) | ✅ #32 tag `p3-session4-complete` |
| **S5** | Frontend chat panel | ⏳ next |
| **S6** | Tests + smoke + exit gate | ⏳ |

### P3 architectural commitment
[ADR 0006 — LLM not in the order path](../docs/adr/0006-llm-not-in-order-path.md) (merged via #30) constrains every future agent-related PR. The CI invariant `apps/backend/scripts/check_no_llm_in_order_path.sh` enforces it: Anthropic SDK use is allowed in `app/agent/`, `app/services/morning_brief.py` (P5.5 §2, future), `app/services/strategy_review.py` (P6, future), `app/services/drift_detection.py` (P6, future) — never in `app/orders/router.py`, `app/risk/`, `app/brokers/`, or strategy execution. **B3 (autonomous order submission) is paused indefinitely** — the `AgentSessionMode.B3_AUTONOMOUS` enum value stays reserved but the runtime rejects sessions started in that mode.

### P3 settled decisions
- **Modes:** B1 (read-only) + B2 (interactive) ship in P3; B3 (Agent Strategy submitting orders) reserved enum value, runtime-gated in Session 3, fully implemented in P6.
- **Cost cap:** $2/day per user across all sessions; configurable via `AGENT_DAILY_BUDGET_USD`.
- **Default model:** Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`).
- **Anthropic key handling:** env var `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` only for MVP; per-user encrypted in `system_config` is a P5+ enhancement. Empty key disables agent with a clear runtime error (Session 3).
- **Chat panel placement:** decision deferred to Session 5 when the UI work starts.

## 🗺️ P3 / P5–P7 — Roadmap (untouched)

Captured for orientation; plans land when their turn comes.

| Phase | Theme | Headline outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **P3** | Agent MVP (B1+B2) | Claude Code agent chat panel inside the UI; advisory + propose-and-approve flows. |
| **P5** | Live trading toggle | Live creds, live-mode UI, hard gates, recon. |
| **P6** | Agent autonomy (B3, gated) | Per-strategy autonomous mode with hard budgets + extra audit. Backend-side Anthropic SDK calls with MCP attached. Paper-only by default. |
| **P7** | NL → Python strategy authoring | "Draft strategy with Claude" UI button; backend generates the strategy file. |

## How to use this file

- After each working session, update the top section (Last updated / branch / latest tag) and the relevant phase table.
- When a session lands, link the merging PR + tag in the table; don't expand the row into a checklist.
- Frozen versioned plans live in `docs/implementation/`. This file is the index, not the spec.
